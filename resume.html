            <h3>LyricsLoom: Unraveling Music with Python and Beautiful Soup</h3>
            <p>
              LyricLoom is a <strong>Python</strong> application designed for web scraping
              lyrics from a specified website and storing the gathered song
              information in a <strong>SQLite</strong> database.
            </p>
            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <p>
              The project
              supports multiple features, including the extraction of lyrics,
              artists, tags, and other metadata. Users can contribute to the
              project, and the documentation provides a guide for installation,
              usage, and contribution.

            <h3>DoSdroid: The Power Of The One</h3>
            <p>
              DoSdroid orchestrates the connection and synchronization of multiple
              mobile devices for a coordinated Denial of Service (DoS) attack against
              an HTTP server.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users can publish HTTP servers that become eligible for attack at
              a specified future time. Other users may join the attack, and when
              the opportune moment arrives, they collectively initiate the assault.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Disclaimer:
            </h4>
            <p>
              While the app's description mentions a DoS attack, its
              true purpose lies in leveraging the collaborative power of numerous
              devices for a shared objective. The project also served as an
              exploration into Android's network technologies, including <em>Bluetooth</em>,
              <em>NFC</em>, <em>Wi-Fi P2P</em>, etc., during its development.

            <h4>Availability:</h4>
            <p>
              As a result of its unique nature, this app is not eligible for
              publication on popular stores such as Google Play. Therefore, to
              use the application, you'll need to download the source code and
              build the project on your own.

          <h3>Rebetes: Rediscovering Greek Rebetico Music</h3>
          <p>
            As a passionate advocate for preserving cultural heritage through
            technology, I developed the "Rebetes" (greek <em>Ρεμπέτες</em>) app
            to cater to the needs of professional musicians immersed in the
            enchanting world of Greek rebetico music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rebetico, a rich musical tradition, often finds its stage in lively
            bars and taverns where musicians embark on 4-5 hour sessions.
            Recognizing the challenge of memorizing an extensive repertoire of
            over 2000 songs, the Rebetiko app was born to be the ultimate
            companion for these musicians.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Key Freatures:
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Offline Accessibility</em>: The app provides a comprehensive collection
              of rebetico song lyrics (nearly all of them), artist information,
              including composers,
              singers, and authors, along with music details such as scales and
              rhythms. All of this valuable information is available offline,
              eliminating the need for an internet connection during performances.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Intuitive Search</em>: A fast and user-friendly search functionality
              empowers musicians to swiftly locate specific songs or explore the
              vast rebetico repertoire.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Playlist Creation</em>: To streamline their performances, users can
              effortlessly create playlists tailored to each session, ensuring a
              seamless and immersive musical experience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            Tech Stack:
          </h4>
          <p>
            Built with <strong>Flutter</strong> and <strong>Dart</strong>, the Rebetiko app operates smoothly on
            Android and iOS devices. Its strong foundation lies in a robust <strong>SQLite</strong>
            database for efficient storage. <strong>Python</strong> scripts were employed to
            scrape information from diverse online sources.
          </p>

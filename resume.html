        <h2>Profile</h2>

        <p>
          <h3><img class="skill-item" src="images/skills/intro_code.svg"/>My Approach to Software Development</h3>
          I started as a Clean Code enthusiast, but over time, I’ve embraced a pragmatic approach. My goal is to write code that works effectively, with readability and design being equally important. I’ve worked with messy legacy systems as well as well-architected, structured codebases—gaining insight into both worlds (there's much to learn in both cases btw). While some say <strong>TDD</strong> is dead, I find value in the approach and use it when it makes sense. I prefer on-site collaboration over remote work, as I enjoy exchanging ideas on a personal level—making <strong>pair programming</strong> a natural fit for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3><img class="skill-item" src="images/skills/intro_dotnet.svg"/>.NET</h3>
          With over 4 years of professional experience in <strong>.NET and C#</strong>, I have developed web applications using <strong>Blazor</strong>, deployed them on <strong>Azure</strong>, and implemented robust <strong>authentication and authorization</strong> mechanisms. Additionally, I have extensive experience in desktop application development with <strong>WPF</strong> and earlier <strong>Windows Forms</strong>. And yes I've used <strong>MVVM</strong> extensively.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3><img class="skill-item" src="images/skills/intro_database.svg"/>Databases</h3>
          I have extensive experience in <strong>designing and integrating</strong> databases, specializing in both SQL (SQL Server, MySQL, and more) and NoSQL (Firebase) systems. 
          I frequently use ORMs like Entity Framework and NHibernate when necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3><img class="skill-item" src="images/skills/intro_mobile.svg"/>Mobile App Development</h3>
          I have designed, developed, and published mobile applications, originally as a hobby, with some even becoming profitable. 
          My journey started with native Android apps built using <strong>Java</strong>, but I’ve thoroughly enjoyed creating hybrid solutions with <strong>Flutter</strong>. You can browse some of them <a href="./#published-projects-section">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3><img class="skill-item" src="images/skills/intro_ai.svg"/>LLMs</h3>
          Since their emergence, I’ve used large language models like ChatGPT and Copilot to boost productivity across various tasks. While I acknowledge their remarkable capabilities, I remain cautious about relying on them for software development, where precision and trust in the code are paramount. What I am definitelly going to do in the future is to develop systems that make use of LLMs, that would be fun!
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3><img class="skill-item" src="images/skills/intro_linux.svg"/>Additional Skills and Interests</h3>
          As mentioned, I am a passionate <strong>Linux</strong> user, both on Desktop and Server environments. I find the CLI incredibly user-friendly when I know what I’m doing, allowing me to focus on the information I need without unnecessary clutter. If asked about my favorite language, I would say <strong>C</strong>. I prefer writing code in text editors, with <strong>Sublime Text</strong> being my favorite. When debugging is essential, I rely on <strong>Visual Studio</strong> or <strong>Rider</strong>. I am curious about Vim, maybe that will be the next and final option.

          <h3>Rebetes: Rediscovering Greek Rebetico Music</h3>
          <p>
            As a passionate advocate for preserving cultural heritage through
            technology, I developed the "Rebetes" (greek <em>Ρεμπέτες</em>) app
            to cater to the needs of professional musicians immersed in the
            enchanting world of Greek rebetico music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rebetico, a rich musical tradition, often finds its stage in lively
            bars and taverns where musicians embark on 4-5 hour sessions.
            Recognizing the challenge of memorizing an extensive repertoire of
            over 2000 songs, the Rebetiko app was born to be the ultimate
            companion for these musicians.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Key Freatures:
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Offline Accessibility</em>: The app provides a comprehensive collection
              of rebetico song lyrics (nearly all of them), artist information,
              including composers,
              singers, and authors, along with music details such as scales and
              rhythms. All of this valuable information is available offline,
              eliminating the need for an internet connection during performances.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Intuitive Search</em>: A fast and user-friendly search functionality
              empowers musicians to swiftly locate specific songs or explore the
              vast rebetico repertoire.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Playlist Creation</em>: To streamline their performances, users can
              effortlessly create playlists tailored to each session, ensuring a
              seamless and immersive musical experience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            Tech Stack:
          </h4>
          <p>
            Built with <strong>Flutter</strong> and <strong>Dart</strong>, the Rebetiko app operates smoothly on
            Android and iOS devices. Its strong foundation lies in a robust <strong>SQLite</strong>
            database for efficient storage. <strong>Python</strong> scripts were employed to
            scrape information from diverse online sources.
          </p>

  <h3>DoSdroid: The Power Of The One</h3>
  <p>
    DoSdroid orchestrates the connection and synchronization of multiple
    mobile devices for a coordinated Denial of Service (DoS) attack against
    an HTTP server.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users can publish HTTP servers that become eligible for attack at
    a specified future time. Other users may join the attack, and when
    the opportune moment arrives, they collectively initiate the assault.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Disclaimer:
  </h4>
  <p>
    While the app's description mentions a DoS attack, its
    true purpose lies in leveraging the collaborative power of numerous
    devices for a shared objective. The project also served as an
    exploration into Android's network technologies, including <em>Bluetooth</em>,
    <em>NFC</em>, <em>Wi-Fi P2P</em>, etc., during its development.
  </p>
  <h4>Availability:</h4>
  <p>
    As a result of its unique nature, this app is not eligible for
    publication on popular stores such as Google Play. Therefore, to
    use the application, you'll need to download the source code and
    build the project on your own.

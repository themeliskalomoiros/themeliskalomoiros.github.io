        <h2>Profile</h2>

        <p>
          <h3>.NET Expertise</h3>
          I'm a Software Engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science and 
          over four years of experience in software development using 
          <strong>.NET and C#</strong>. My work has involved a variety of projects, 
          including Web Apps with <strong>Blazor</strong> and desktop applications 
          using <strong>WPF and Windows Forms</strong>. I've successfully deployed applications 
          on <strong>Azure</strong>, incorporating 
          <strong>authentication and authorization</strong> mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Database Expertise</h3>
          My experience includes extensive work in <strong>designing and integrating</strong> databases, 
          with a focus on SQL (SQL-Server, MySQL, and others) or NoSQL (Firebase) databases. 
          Most of the times I use an ORM such as <strong>Entity Framework</strong> 
          (or NHibernate in the past) but that's not a must.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
          I've also designed, developed, and published mobile applications on Google Play. 
          Some of these apps have even been profitable. In the past these were Android 
          applications built with <strong>Java</strong> but nowadays I enjoy using hybrid solutions like 
          <strong>Flutter</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Software Development Practices</h3>
          In my coding practice, I prioritize disciplines like <strong>Clean Code</strong> and <strong>TDD</strong>, 
          and I greatly enjoy <strong>pair programming</strong>. But since we leave in the real world I 
          am also trying to maintaining a pragmatic approach to coding, 
          ensuring the delivery of robust and reliable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Use of Language Models</h3>
          Since their emergence, I've utilized large language models like 
          ChatGPT and CoPilot to enhance my productivity, always mindful 
          of their capabilities and limitations. While these tools are 
          remarkable, I recognize they are not infallible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Additional Skills and Interests</h3>
          Beyond my technical skills, I have a strong affinity for <strong>Linux</strong> environments 
          and enjoy scripting with <strong>Bash</strong>. I frequently develop applications 
          using <strong>Python</strong>, including projects involving <strong>web-scraping</strong> with 
          frameworks like Beautiful Soup and Selenium. 
          I derive great satisfaction from <strong>mentoring</strong> junior developers and am fluent in 
          German (B1), English (C1), and Greek (native). Outside of work, 
          I unwind by playing music with friends.
        </p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>Beyond my experience in software companies and as an independent software developer, I've undertaken diverse roles in various fields. In this section, I will specifically highlight those positions directly related to software.</p>

              At <a href="https://www.dvgw-sc.de/">DVGW Service & Consult</a>, we develop solutions for external clients or for internal consumption primarily using Microsoft technologies. Our software
              is mostly developed under <strong>.NET</strong>, deployed in <strong>Azure</strong>
              and we use extensively Microsoft Dynamics 365, supplemented by other technologies such as Python and PHP when necessary. We manage our, many and quite large, <strong>databases</strong> mainly with <strong>SQL-Server</strong> or MySql and use extensively ORMs like <strong>EF-Core</strong> (and in some case NHibernate). 
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I specialize in <strong>revitalizing older software systems</strong> and custom libraries by <strong>modernizing</strong> them to meet current standards. This involves tasks like reengineering and, at times, rebuilding projects originally developed on platforms <strong>like Windows Forms and WPF</strong>, transitioning them to newer web technologies like <strong>Blazor</strong>. This ensures that these systems remain efficient and aligned with our organization's evolving needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the near future (mainly for security reasons which we take seriously) we will be creating
              <strong>apps that make use of the LLMs and AI</strong>.

            <h3>Rebetes: Rediscovering Greek Rebetico Music</h3>
            <p>
              As a passionate advocate for preserving cultural heritage through
              technology, I developed the "Rebetes" (greek <em>Ρεμπέτες</em>) app
              to cater to the needs of professional musicians immersed in the
              enchanting world of Greek rebetico music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rebetico, a rich musical tradition, often finds its stage in lively
              bars and taverns where musicians embark on 4-5 hour sessions.
              Recognizing the challenge of memorizing an extensive repertoire of
              over 2000 songs, the Rebetiko app was born to be the ultimate
              companion for these musicians.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Key Freatures:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Offline Accessibility</em>: The app provides a comprehensive collection
                of rebetico song lyrics (nearly all of them), artist information,
                including composers,
                singers, and authors, along with music details such as scales and
                rhythms. All of this valuable information is available offline,
                eliminating the need for an internet connection during performances.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Intuitive Search</em>: A fast and user-friendly search functionality
                empowers musicians to swiftly locate specific songs or explore the
                vast rebetico repertoire.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Playlist Creation</em>: To streamline their performances, users can
                effortlessly create playlists tailored to each session, ensuring a
                seamless and immersive musical experience.

              Tech Stack:

              Built with <strong>Flutter</strong> and <strong>Dart</strong>, the Rebetiko app operates smoothly on
              Android and iOS devices. Its strong foundation lies in a robust <strong>SQLite</strong>
              database for efficient storage. <strong>Python</strong> scripts were employed to
              scrape information from diverse online sources.

    <h3>DoSdroid: The Power Of The One</h3>
    <p>
      DoSdroid orchestrates the connection and synchronization of multiple
      mobile devices for a coordinated Denial of Service (DoS) attack against
      an HTTP server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users can publish HTTP servers that become eligible for attack at
      a specified future time. Other users may join the attack, and when
      the opportune moment arrives, they collectively initiate the assault.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Disclaimer:
    </h4>
    <p>
      While the app's description mentions a DoS attack, its
      true purpose lies in leveraging the collaborative power of numerous
      devices for a shared objective. The project also served as an
      exploration into Android's network technologies, including <em>Bluetooth</em>,
      <em>NFC</em>, <em>Wi-Fi P2P</em>, etc., during its development.
    </p>
    <h4>Availability:</h4>
    <p>
      As a result of its unique nature, this app is not eligible for
      publication on popular stores such as Google Play. Therefore, to
      use the application, you'll need to download the source code and
      build the project on your own.
